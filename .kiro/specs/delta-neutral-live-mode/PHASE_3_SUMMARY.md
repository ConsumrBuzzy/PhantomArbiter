# Phase 3 Summary: Live Mode Capital Management

**Phase**: Phase 3 - Live Mode Capital Management  
**Date**: 2026-01-15  
**Status**: ✅ Complete (6/6 tasks complete)

---

## Overview

Phase 3 enables safe capital management for the Delta Neutral Engine in live mode. Users can deposit and withdraw SOL collateral from their Drift Protocol sub-accounts via the Web UI, with comprehensive safety checks to prevent liquidation risk. The Engine_Vault automatically synchronizes with on-chain state to maintain accurate capital tracking.

## Architecture

### Component Flow

```
Web UI (DEPOSIT/WITHDRAW command)
    ↓
LocalDashboardServer (WebSocket)
    ↓
FundingEngine.execute_funding_command()
    ↓
DriftAdapter.deposit() / withdraw()
    ↓
DriftClient SDK (driftpy)
    ↓
Drift Protocol (Solana)
```

### Safety Layers

1. **Input Validation**: Amount, balance, connection checks
2. **Health Ratio Check**: Prevents withdrawals that risk liquidation
3. **Transaction Simulation**: Catches errors before submission
4. **Confirmation Waiting**: Ensures transaction success
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on failures

## Next Steps

### Task 12: Manual Testing Checkpoint
1. Test deposit via UI with vault sync verification
2. Test withdrawal via UI with vault sync verification
3. Verify vault balances in database
4. Test retry logic with simulated failures

### After Phase 3
1. Complete Task 12 checkpoint (manual testing)
2. Proceed to Phase 4 (Live Mode Trading)
3. Implement position opening/closing
4. Add safety gates and risk controls
